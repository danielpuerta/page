        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Black Sabbath were an English rock band, 
            formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main 
            songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler,
            drummer Bill Ward, and singer Ozzy Osbourne. Black Sabbath are 
            often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music.[1] The band helped 
            define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid
            970), and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes,
            with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.
            Formed in 1968 as the Polka Tulk Blues Band, a blues rock band, 
            the group went through line up changes, renamed themselves as Earth,
             broke up and reformed. By 1969, they had named themselves Black 
             Sabbath after the film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff, and
              began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and 
              tuned-down guitars. The band's first show as Black Sabbath took 
              place on 30 August 1969, in Workington.</p>

              <p>Osbourne's regular use of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal 
                from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie 
                James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel
                changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes
                , Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1991, 
                Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer
                (1992). The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live 
                 album Reunion. Black Sabbath's final studio album and nineteenth overall, 13 
                (2013), features all of the original members but Ward, who left the band prior
                to the recording sessions due to a contract dispute. A year after embarking 
                on a farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city
                of Birmingham on 4 February 2017,[2] after which they broke up.[3] Iommi has
                stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of new material or one-off 
                shows under the Black Sabbath name.[4]</p>
